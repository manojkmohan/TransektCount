Installation of TransektCount

Download either from F-Droid store, (app only but with future updates from F-Droid store)
or get the app directly from Author's GitHub page (most up to date development status). 


- From F-Droid:
  only apps, without docs or Basic-DB but with updates by F-Droid app 
  (signed by F-Droid, therefore not updatable with the developer's version):

  https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.wmstein.transektcount

  After installing by F-Droid repository you should also look at the author's GitHub pages (see below) for 
  docs and Basic-DB as well as example DBs. 

  
- From the author's GitHub project pages:
  (current processing status) with app, source code, docs and Basic- and sample-DBs:

  app, apk file:	https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/apk
  Docs and DBs:		https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs

  
Activate the Android option "Unknown source" in "Settings -> Security" before Installation.

After downloading install the app by clicking its apk-file in the download folder.
Copy the relevant Basic-DB and sample DBs from the download folder to the app's files-folder: 
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files.

Important: Finally deactivate the option "Unknown source"!

Remark:

Usage of the F-Droid store is as safe as Google's Play Store.
Privacy is a concern and all apps are checked and compiled by F-Droid. 
Antifeatures like Ads, tracking or hidden costs will be listet in the app's description.

The apk file (installable app) published under GitHub is functional identic with the one of F-Droid. 
But there is a difference in the compilation key. Therefore an installed apk file from GitHub cannot be updated by an apk file from F-Droid and vice versa.
In case you change the installation source you have to reinstall the app.

Mind that de-installation of the app deletes also all files in 
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files.
