Installation of TransektCount and TourCount

2 Options:  

- from F-Droid:
  only apps, without docs or Basic-DB but with updates by F-Droid app 
  (signed by F-Droid, therefore not updatable with the developer's version):

  https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.wmstein.transektcount
  https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.wmstein.tourcount

  When installing by F-Droid app you should also look at the author's GitHub pages (see below) for 
  docs and Basic-DB as well as example DBs. 

- From the author's GitHub project pages:
  (current processing status) with app, source code, docs and Basic- and sample-DBs:

  TransektCount app, most up-to-date apk file (with the author's signature, therefore not updatable 
  with the F-Droid version):
	https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/apk
  Docs and DBs:
	https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs

  TourCount app, most up-to-date apk file (with the author's signature, therefore not updatable with 
  the F-Droid version):
	https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/apk
  Docs and DBs:
	https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs

  Activate the Android option "Unknown source" in "Settings -> Security" before Installation.

  After downloading install the app by clicking its apk-file in the download folder.
  Copy the relevant Basic-DB and sample DBs from the download folder to the basic folder 
  (/storage/emulated/0).

  Important: Finally deactivate the option "Unknown source"!

Remark:

Getting apps from F-Droid is at least as safe as getting apps from Google's Play Store.
All apps get examined and compiled by F-Droid themselves. 
If an app will not comply to all privacy requirements of F-Droid, it is annotated.
The source code of the apps is published and licensed as Open Source.
